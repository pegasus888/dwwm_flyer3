                if you have an idea of what you want to make, what you were put here to do, then just go and do that. And that’s much harder than it sounds. And sometimes in the end so much easier than you might imagine.

                <span class="text-altmydarblue opacity-25">[(...)]</span>
                <br class="mb-3">
                  Something that worked for me was imagining that where I wanted to be.
                <span class="text-altmydarblue opacity-25">[(...)]</span> Imagining that was a mountain, a distant mountain, my goal. And I knew that as long as I kept walking towards the mountain, I’d be all right. And when I truly was not sure what to do, I could stop and think about whether it was taking me towards or away from the mountain.
                <br class="mb-3">
                <span class="text-altmydarblue opacity-25">[(...)]</span>
                   when you start out, you have to deal with the problems of failure. You need to be thick-skinned to learn that not every project will survive. <span class="text-altmydarblue opacity-25">[(...)]</span>
                  The problems of failure, or problems of discouragement, of hopelessness, of hunger. You want everything to happen and you want it now when things go wrong.
                <span class="text-altmydarblue opacity-25">[(...)]</span>
                  and I decided that I do my best in future not to write books just for the money. If you didn’t get the money, then you didn’t have anything. And if I did work I was proud of and I didn’t get the money, at least I’d have the work. Every now and then I forget that rule. And whenever I do, the universe kicks me hard and reminds me. <span class="text-altmydarblue opacity-25">[(...)]</span>
                <br class="mb-3">
                  I hope you’ll make mistakes. If you make mistakes, it means you’re out there doing something. And the mistakes in themselves can be very useful. <span class="text-altmydarblue opacity-25">[(...)]</span>
                <br class="mb-3">
                  Remember whatever discipline you’re in, <span class="text-altmydarblue opacity-25">[(...)]</span>, whatever you do, you have one thing that’s unique. You have the ability to make art. And for me and for so many of the people I’ve known that’s been a lifesaver, the ultimate lifesaver. It gets you through good times and it gets you through the other ones. Sometimes life is hard. Things go wrong in life and in love and in business and in friendship and in health and in all the other ways that life can go wrong. And when things get tough, this is what you should do. Make good art. I’m serious. <span class="text-altmydarblue opacity-25">[(...)]</span>
                <br class="mb-3">
                  Someone on the internet thinks what you’re doing is stupid or evil or it’s all been done before? Make good art. <span class="text-altmydarblue opacity-25">[(...)]</span>
                <br class="mb-3">
                  Do what only you can do best <span class="text-altmydarblue opacity-25">[(...)]</span>. <br class="mb-3">
                  Make it on the bad days. Make it on the good days too. And <span class="text-altmydarblue opacity-25">[(...)]</span> while you’re at it, make your art. Do the stuff that only you can do. <span class="text-altmydarblue opacity-25">[(...)]</span>
                <br class="mb-3">
                  I learned it in comics, but it applies to other fields too and it’s this: People get hired because somehow they get hired. <span class="text-altmydarblue opacity-25">[(...)]</span>
                  But people keep working in a freelance world, and more and more of today’s world is freelance, because the work is good and because they’re easy to get along with and because they deliver the work on time and you don’t even need all three. Two out of three is fine. People will tolerate how unpleasant you are if your work is good and you deliver it on time.People will forgive the lateness of your work if it’s good and they like you. And you don’t have to be as good as everyone else if you’re on time and it’s always a pleasure to hear from you.
                <br class="mb-3">
                <span class="text-altmydarblue opacity-25">[(...)]</span> for the next 14 or 15 years <span class="text-altmydarblue opacity-25">[(...)]</span> I didn’t stop and look around and go, ‘This is really fun.’ I wish I’d enjoyed it more. It’s been an amazing ride. But there were parts of the ride I missed, because I was too worried about things going wrong, about what came next to enjoy the bit that I was on. That was the hardest lesson for me, I think, to let go and enjoy the ride. Because the ride takes you to some remarkable and unexpected places. <span class="text-altmydarblue opacity-25">[(...)]</span>
                <br class="mb-3">
                  So be wise because the world needs more wisdom. And if you cannot be wise, pretend to be someone who is wise, and then just behave like they would.
                <br class="mb-3"> And now go and make interesting mistakes, make amazing mistakes, make glorious and fantastic mistakes. Break rules. Leave the world more interesting for your being here. Make good art.
                <br class="mb-3">
                  Thank you.”
